            Gene to Protein Pvt. Ltd. was conceived with the idea of providing
            an end-to-end service to Life science researchers from gene cloning
            to protein structure and function. As we started undertaking
            projects for our clients towards this goal, we realized that Indian
            research was completely dependent upon the manufacture and supply of
            biochemicals from foreign lands. Obviously, there was a need to fill
            the gap and prove to not only our own scientists but the world at
            large that India indeed had the prowess to manufacture just anything
            especially with its strong base in Science and Technology.{" "}

            As the Bible quotes Ecclesiastes 3:1-8, 'A Time for Everything’, the
            time for incorporation of Gene to Protein Pvt. Ltd in November of
            2020, falls completely with the need of the hour: “To make India
            Atmanirbhar”. We at Gene to Protein aim to produce all enzymes, kits
            and biochemicals that Indian researchers have so long bought from
            MNCs and foreign manufacturers, at our very own labs at Lucknow and
            Hyderabad respectively.

            We have two verticals: Biological and Chemical wherein we undertake
            manufacture of enzymes, chemicals, fluorophores, and kits which are
            required on a day-to-day basis by most labs in life sciences
            research and diagnostics. We also specialise in offering custom
            services like cloning into varied vectors of interest, expression
            optimization to get soluble, correctly folded proteins, testing
            various crystallization conditions to maximize number of hits.
            Alongside we offer all related services in genomics and proteomics
            which include nucleic acid purifications.We aim for the highest
            standards of quality and consistency, which may indeed be the
            cornerstone of winning people’s trust.

          <p className="hidden md:block">
            We are a vibrant group of scientists experimenting with the old and
            the new to offer you alternatives to your favourite and most trusted
            brands but manufactured 100% indigenously. We are advised by top
            scientists from premier academic institutions as we believe that it
            is only by dialog and collaboration that new ideas and products are
            born.
