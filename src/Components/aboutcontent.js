      <p>Gene to Protein Pvt. Ltd. was conceived with the idea of providing an end-to-end service to Life science researchers from gene cloning to protein structure and function. As we started undertaking projects for our clients towards this goal, we realized that Indian research was completely dependent upon the manufacture and supply of biochemicals from foreign lands. Obviously, there was a need to fill the gap and prove to not only our own scientists but the world at large that India indeed had the prowess to manufacture just anything especially with its strong base in Science and Technology. </p>
      <p>As the Bible quotes Ecclesiastes 3:1-8, 'A Time for Everything’, the time for incorporation of Gene to Protein Pvt. Ltd in November of 2020, falls completely with the need of the hour: “To make India Atmanirbhar”. We at Gene to Protein aim to produce all enzymes, kits and biochemicals that Indian researchers have so long bought from MNCs and foreign manufacturers, at our very own labs at Lucknow and Hyderabad respectively.

      We have two verticals: Biological and Chemical wherein we undertake manufacture of enzymes, chemicals, fluorophores, and kits which are required on a day-to-day basis by most labs in life sciences research and diagnostics. We also specialise in offering custom services like cloning into varied vectors of interest, expression optimization to get soluble, correctly folded proteins, testing various crystallization conditions to maximize number of hits. Alongside we offer all related services in genomics and proteomics which include nucleic acid purifications.We aim for the highest standards of quality and consistency, which may indeed be the cornerstone of winning people’s trust.

      We are a vibrant group of scientists experimenting with the old and the new to offer you alternatives to your favourite and most trusted brands but manufactured 100% indigenously. We are advised by top scientists from premier academic institutions as we believe that it is only by dialog and collaboration that new ideas and products are born.
