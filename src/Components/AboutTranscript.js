        Gene to Protein Pvt. Ltd. was conceived with the idea of providing an
        end-to-end service to Life science researchers right from gene cloning
        to protein structure and function. As we started undertaking projects
        for our clients towards this goal, we realized that Indian research is
        completely dependant upon the manufacture and supply of biochemicals
        from foreign lands. Obviously, there was a need to fill the gap and
        prove to not only our own scientists but the world at large that India
        indeed had the prowess to manufacture just anything especially with its
        strong base in Science and Technology. As the Bible quotes Ecclesiastes
        3:1-8, 'A Time for Everything, the time for incorporation of Gene to
        Protein Pvt. Ltd in November of 2020, falls completely with the need of
        the hour: “To make India Atmanirbhar”. We at Gene to Protein aim to
        produce all enzymes, kits and biochemicals that Indian researchers have
        so long bought from MNCs and foreign manufacturers, at our very own labs
        at both north and south India at Lucknow and Hyderabad respectively. We
        aim for the highest standards of quality and consistency, which may
        indeed be the cornerstone of winning people’s trust. In a short span of
        time, we have managed to produce successfully many enzymes and kits used
        in Life sciences research and diagnostics. We are a vibrant group of
        scientists experimenting with the old and the new to offer you
        alternatives to your favourite and most trusted brands but manufactured
        100% indigenously. We have two verticals: Biological and Chemical
        wherein we undertake manufacture of enzymes, chemicals, fluorophores,
        and kits which are required on a day-to-day basis by most labs in life
        sciences research and diagnostics. We also specialise in offering custom
        services like cloning into varied vectors of interest, expression
        optimization to get soluble, correctly folded proteins, testing various
        crystallization conditions to maximize number of hits. Alongside we
        offer all related services in genomics and proteomics which include
        nucleic acid purifications. We are advised by top scientists from
        premier academic institutions as we believe that it is only by dialog
        and collaborations that new ideas and products are born. We look to you
        for your support in our journey to take India a step closer to
        self-sufficiency. Boycott and Swadeshi were two slogans which drove the
        Indian freedom struggle, now we appeal to the Indian in you to carry
        forward these to S&T in the 21st century where we can show to the world
        that “Make in India” truly is successful. .
