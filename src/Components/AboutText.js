                Gene to Protein Pvt. Ltd. was conceived with the idea of providing an end-to-end service to Life science researchers from gene cloning to protein structure and function. As we started undertaking projects for our clients towards this goal, we realized that Indian research was completely dependent upon the manufacture and supply of biochemicals from foreign lands. Obviously, there was a need to fill the gap and prove to not only our own scientists but the world at large that India indeed had the prowess to manufacture just anything especially with its strong base in Science and Technology.
